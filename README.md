# Tech Troubleshooter üñ•Ô∏è
A guideline to build a RAG-based tech troubleshooting chatbot

This README provides a structured and detailed guide to help users through the process of creating and deploying a customized RAG-based tech troubleshooting chatbot using Hugging Face Spaces and Gradio, highlighting key steps and customization options, complete with useful links for easy navigation.

## Build and Deploy Your Custom RAG-Based Tech Troubleshooting Bot

### Introduction
Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) bot can significantly enhance the capabilities of a language model by incorporating external knowledge to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses. This guide will walk you through creating a RAG-based tech troubleshooting chatbot using Gradio and the Hugging Face APIs.

### Why Use RAG for Tech Troubleshooting?

RAG improves the performance of language models by augmenting them with external documents. This method retrieves relevant documents based on the user query and combines them with the original prompt before passing them to the language model for response generation. This approach ensures that the language model can access up-to-date and domain-specific information without the need for extensive retraining.

### How RAG Enhances LLM‚Äôs Performance

1. **Input**: The question to which the LLM system responds is referred to as the input. Without RAG, the LLM responds directly to the question.
2. **Indexing**: With RAG, related documents are indexed by chunking them first, generating embeddings of the chunks, and indexing them into a vector store. At inference, the query is also embedded similarly.
3. **Retrieval**: Relevant documents are obtained by comparing the query against the indexed vectors, referred to as ‚ÄúRelevant Documents‚Äù.
4. **Generation**: The relevant documents are combined with the original prompt as additional context. The combined text and prompt are then passed to the model for response generation, resulting in the final output.

### Prerequisites
Before you start creating your chatbot, make sure you have the following:

- **A Hugging Face Account**: Essential for accessing the platform where you'll build and host your chatbot. Sign up [here](https://huggingface.co/join).

### Setup and Deployment

1. **Choosing Your Chatbot‚Äôs Identity**: Decide what your chatbot will specialize in. This could be anything from a tech troubleshooter, book recommender, chef, or even a relaxing buddy to help you unwind. The role you choose will define the interactions and capabilities of your chatbot.

2. **Logging into Hugging Face**: You'll need an account to access the tools required for deploying your chatbot. If you don't have an account, signing up is straightforward and quick.

3. **Navigating to Hugging Face Spaces**: Spaces are where the magic happens. This section of Hugging Face allows users to create and manage their applications seamlessly. Navigate to [Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) to get started.

4. **Creating Your Space**: Initiate a new space by clicking on 'Create New Space'. It‚Äôs important that the name of your Space reflects the chatbot's role, as it helps in identifying the application‚Äôs purpose at a glance.

5. **Configuring Your Chatbot**:

   - **Selecting the Framework and Model**: Choose 'Gradio' as the framework for its user-friendly interface capabilities, and select a suitable model, such as 'Zephyr 7B', known for its versatility across various tasks.
   - **Customization**: Here‚Äôs where you personalize the chatbot. Tailor system messages and interaction style based on the role. This customization will enable your chatbot to interact appropriately according to its role.
   - **Deployment**: Once setup is complete, deploy your chatbot by simply clicking the create button. Deployment usually takes a couple of minutes. After this, your chatbot will be up and running and ready to interact.

### Customization Example
To make your chatbot truly unique, consider personalizing it extensively. For instance, if you choose a 'Tech Troubleshooter' role:

- Modify the system messages to include engaging phrases and troubleshooting steps.
- Program the chatbot to ask about the user's technical issue, device details, and symptoms.
- Offer step-by-step solutions, tips, and common fixes for technical problems.

### Example Usage
Here are some examples of how the "Tech Troubleshooter üñ•Ô∏è" can be used:

- **Troubleshooting Network Issues**: "My internet connection keeps dropping. What can I do?" üåê
- **Software Problems**: "Why is my computer running slow after a software update?" üñ•Ô∏è
- **Hardware Issues**: "How can I fix my laptop's overheating problem?" üîß
